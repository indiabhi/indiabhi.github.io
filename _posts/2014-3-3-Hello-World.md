I am intending to  blog about my journey into Software Development in this blog. I like developing applications
in Python and Django. Right now I am also learning JavaScript.
I am intending to complete Udacity's Front End NanoDegree program and Full Stack Developer Program in coming two 
months.
You can find me on [Linkedin](https://in.linkedin.com/in/713abhi) here.

Hoping for the best!
